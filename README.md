# KHTML

HTML rendering engine

## Introduction

KHTML is a web rendering engine, based on the KParts technology and using KJS for JavaScript support.

## Design

The library consists of many different parts. Basically, when you use the lib, you
create an instance of a KHTMLPart, and feed data to it. That's more or less all you need to 
know if you want to use khtml for another application.
